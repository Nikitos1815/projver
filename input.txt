The several answers that purport to show how to do this are all wrong because Java characters are not ASCII characters. Java uses a multibyte encoding of Unicode characters. The Unicode character set is a super set of ASCII. So there can be characters in a Java string that do not belong to ASCII. Such characters do not have an ASCII numeric value, so asking how to get the ASCII numeric value of a Java character is unanswerable.
